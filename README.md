## Major Learnings

### 1. **Key Technologies Covered**

Throughout the program, the following technologies and tools are introduced and used in projects:

- **Next.js** — routing, server-side rendering, API routes  
- **React** — components, hooks, state management  
- **TypeScript** — static typing for scalability  
- **TailwindCSS** — utility-first CSS for faster styling  
- **GraphQL** — structured API querying and schema design  
- **REST API Integration** — fetching, handling, and rendering data  
- **Version Control (Git & GitHub)**  
- **Progressive Web Apps (PWA)** basics  
- **System Design & Analysis** — diagrams, workflows, and app architecture

### 2. **Important Frontend Development Concepts**

The program builds a strong foundation in:

- Component-based architecture  
- State and data flow management  
- Reusable UI patterns  
- Form handling and validation  
- Asynchronous JavaScript  
- User experience optimization  
- Static vs dynamic rendering  
- Responsive layouts and accessibility

## Challenges Faced & Solutions Implemented

### **Challenge 1: Learning New Frameworks (Next.js, TypeScript)**
**Solution:**  
Practiced daily, used official docs, and built small demo apps to understand routing, props, and server components.

### **Challenge 2: Styling Efficiently With TailwindCSS**
**Solution:**  
Memorized core utility classes, created reusable style patterns, and referred to Tailwind documentation while building components.

### **Challenge 3: Debugging API Integration Issues**
**Solution:**  
Used browser developer tools, console logs, Postman, and structured error handling to isolate issues in APIs and UI rendering.
